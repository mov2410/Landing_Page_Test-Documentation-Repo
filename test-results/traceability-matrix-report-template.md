- **Project ID:** [Enter Project ID]
- **Project Manager:** [Enter Project Manager]
- **Date:** [Enter Date]

## Purpose
The purpose of this Traceability Matrix is to establish and maintain traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects throughout the testing process.

## Traceability Matrix

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Test Case ID | Test Case Description | Defect ID | Defect Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Req ID] | [Req Description] | [Test Case ID] | [Test Case Description] | [Defect ID] | [Defect Description] |
| [Req ID] | [Req Description] | [Test Case ID] | [Test Case Description] | [Defect ID] | [Defect Description] |
| [Req ID] | [Req Description] | [Test Case ID] | [Test Case Description] | [Defect ID] | [Defect Description] |
| [Req ID] | [Req Description] | [Test Case ID] | [Test Case Description] | [Defect ID] | [Defect Description] |

## Notes
- Please update this Traceability Matrix as new requirements, test cases, or defects are identified or modified.
- Ensure that all requirements have associated test cases, and all defects are linked to the corresponding test cases and requirements.
- Review and verify the accuracy of the Traceability Matrix regularly throughout the testing process.

## Appendix

### Explanation of Columns:

Requirement ID: Unique identifier for each requirement.
Requirement Description: Description or details of each requirement.
Test Case ID(s): Test case ID(s) associated with each requirement.
Test Case Description(s): Description or details of test case(s) associated with each requirement.
Test Case Execution Status: Status of test case execution (e.g., Passed, Failed, Not Executed, In Progress).
Comments/Notes: Additional comments, notes, or observations related to the requirement or test case.

### Usage:

- Fill in each row with the corresponding Requirement ID, Requirement Description, Test Case ID(s), Test Case Description(s), Test Case Execution Status, and Comments/Notes.
- Update the Test Case Execution Status as test cases are executed and add any relevant comments or notes.
- Use this matrix to ensure that all requirements have associated test cases and that all test cases are linked back to requirements.
- Update and maintain the Traceability Matrix Report throughout the project lifecycle to track the coverage of requirements by test cases and to ensure thorough testing.
